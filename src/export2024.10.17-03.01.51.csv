This research paper deeply explores the influence of data science utilizing Python as a programming language and machine learning models up to the deep intricacies of public opinion, political campaigns, and political behavior. As such, this study aims to shed light on the contours and dynamics within these arenas - providing crucial insights into the complex interplay between advances in information technology and developments in democratic practices. With the unrivaled availability of data, our study taps into a wide range of datasets that cover election results, voters’ attributes, social media interactions, campaigns’ funding, and public sentiment surveys. We make use of Python tools like Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib for the task of conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, as well as machine learning techniques. The findings of our investigation help us understand the comprehensive various ways that focused extensive campaigning by data-driven insights impact public perceptions. The research bravely shows associations between the emotion that was expressed on social media and election results, leaving no doubt as to the degree to which the digital platform has become influential in shaping current political discussions. Further, the changing approaches in campaigns have been proven to predict effectively through the models of machine learning, the changes in public mood. In essence, this study attempts to make a valuable contribution toward the scholarly understanding of the dynamic political setting and, simultaneously, offer practical implications for political professionals, policymakers, and scholars. The findings highlight the ability of Python programming and machine learning to decipher the nuances that typify contemporary political campaigns hence increasing effectiveness in serving an entire gamut of voter constituencies.

However, as such campaigns are classified as nonprofit in the United States (U.S.), their privacy practices have not received the same level of scrutiny as those of for-profit enterprises. This paper presents the Polityzer framework to evaluate the privacy posture of political campaign websites, and uses it to analyze 2060 campaign websites active during the U.S. election of November 2020. Our analysis leads to 20 key findings that demonstrate gaps in the privacy postures of political campaigns. For instance, we find that campaigns collect extensive private data they are not required to by the Federal Election Commission (FEC), and a vast majority do not provide any form of privacy disclosure. When disclosures are provided, they are often incomplete. We also found that campaigns may be inadvertently sharing data with other campaigns through common fundraising platforms, without disclosing such sharing. Reporting the lack of privacy disclosure to the respective campaigns yields further insights into the rationale behind their security posture. Finally, we discuss ways in which our results could enable future research, inform emerging privacy regulations, and transform user behavior regarding data privacy in this critical context.",2375-1207,979-8-3503-3130-1,10.1109/SP54263.2024.00091,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10646790,us election privacy;2020 election privacy;2020 election security;privacy practices of political campaigns;privacy policy analysis;web security analysis;voter privacy;campaign website security;campaign website privacy,Privacy;Data privacy;Voting;Buildings;Information sharing;Transforms;Regulation,,,,109,IEEE,5-Sep-24,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

Personification as a Communication Strategy in Digital Society,J. D. Akhmedova; I. A. Bykov,"Chair of PR in Politics and Public Administration, St Petersburg State University, St Petersburg, Russia; Chair of PR in Politics and Public Administration, St Petersburg State University, St Petersburg, Russia",2022 Communication Strategies in Digital Society Seminar (ComSDS),9-May-22,2022,,,142,145,"In recent decades, the political game in democratic societies has become increasingly personalized. The role of political parties as representatives of public interests is gradually weakening, which is facilitated by the growing importance of social media. Personalization, as a strategy of political communication, manifests itself during the period of election campaigns, since the electorate chooses specific politicians based on their image recreated in the media. The purpose of this article is to test the hypothesis about the increasing role of social media and the personification of the political game during election campaigns. The research methods include analysis of bibliographic sources and content analysis. The authors studied the profiles from the social network VKontakte belonging to some candidates for deputies of St. Petersburg Legislative Assembly, nominated by the electoral association ""St. Petersburg regional branch of the All-Russian party ""Unity and Fatherland"" - ""United Russia"". Based on the analysis of the content from the profiles on the social network, the hypothesis we had put forward about the increasing role of media during the election campaigns was not confirmed. The authors conclude that political competition is a key factor in the personification of political discourse in mass media. It is shown that, if there is no political competition, politicians lose incentives to disclose personalized information and form a positive image of their personality in social media. The practical significance of the work for representatives of the political community lies in the fact that at present, in order to increase public loyalty to the dominant party and trust in the political activities of public leaders, politicians at all levels of government need to conduct a competent policy in social networks, based on the experience of leading democratic countries.",2768-4873,978-1-6654-8393-3,10.1109/ComSDS55328.2022.9769159,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9769159,personification;political power;social media;social networks;political leadership;political media discourse,Seminars;Public relations;Social networking (online);Voting;Multimedia Web sites;Entertainment industry;Games,,,,15,IEEE,9-May-22,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

The purpose of this research is to study the specific features of the emergence and evolution context of the “Fake news” communication technology. The methodological basis for the analysis is the multiparadigm approach, which allows to combine heuristic potentials of the system-sociological methodology, interactive approach and theory of communicative action. Secondary sources devoted to the problems of modern political communications, as well as thematic content of social networks such as Twitter, Facebook, VKontakte, etc., were the empirical base. The following results were obtained during the performed analysis. Firstly, in recent years the toolkit of modern political communications has been expanding, which testifies to the development of a well-known “electronic or monitoring democracy”, which sometimes is referred to as a democracy of inclusive observation over the activities of ruling political class. At the same time, the mass media are increasingly interfacing with the political space in terms of the use of new information technologies in political communications. Secondly, the role of social media as a channel of political communication is growing. Within the framework of these media, social networks playing a growing role in the political mobilization of masses are becoming the most popular. Thereby, political actors obtain a possibility to coordinate their actions. Thirdly, advertising of political communications takes place. It is expressed in the subordination of political and communication interactions to the laws of advertising business concerning formation of political image of famous leaders. Advertising is supplemented by marketing of political communications, which consists in its impact on electorate by means of resources of “personal”, “software” and “information” influence in order to gain a place in the state and municipal power system. It is ac-companied by distortion and fabrication of facts, tendentious and one-sided editing of misinfor-mation, discrediting of opponents with abnormal rhetoric, labelling and trolling. Three conditions described above constitute the context thanks to which, the “fake news” influence increasingly on political communications. The term “Fake news” is recognized as an expression of 2017 and refers to knowingly false, sensational information disseminated under the guise of news, which also includes the biased journalism, propaganda, hidden advertising, “post-telling” and trolling. Features of the “Fake news” communication technology are the following: high speed of distribution of such messages, wider coverage of audience, difficulties of their identification. Different countries, de-spite the national, cultural and political differences, are trying to fight against the fake news both jointly and separately. In order to limit the impact of the “Fake news” on modern political communications, active countermeasures are being taken by social networks themselves (e.g. Facebook labels them as controversial). However, notable results have not yet been achieved. As a result, fakes have become a threat not only to the mass media and democracy as a whole, but also started to create “obstacles” for political and communication interaction between the real political actors. Researchers have to make additional efforts to analyse online reports in order to ensure the reliability of information disseminated and guarantee that it does not involve fake misinformation.",,978-1-7281-1584-9,10.1109/COMSDS.2019.8709404,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8709404,communication strategy;digital society;fake;«Fake news»;political communications;social networks,Advertising;Media;Facebook;Twitter;Entertainment industry;Market research,,7,,6,IEEE,9-May-19,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences
Communication Strategy of Political Leader’s Image Mythologization in Digital Space during the Course of Election Campaign: Comparative Aspect,L. V. Balakhonskaya; N. N. Zhuravleva; I. V. Beresneva,"St. Petersburg, Russia School of Journalism and Mass Communications, Saint Petersburg State University, Saint Petersburg, Russia; St. Petersburg, Russia School of Journalism and Mass Communications, Saint Petersburg State University, Saint Petersburg, Russia; Herzen State Pedagogical University of Russia, Saint Petersburg, Russia",2019 Communication Strategies in Digital Society Workshop (ComSDS),9-May-19,2019,,,22,29,"In the present paper we address the issue of mythologization as one of the leading communication strategies of the political leader's image formation. Such strategy becomes particularly topical in the period of election campaigns, since political myth as a special form of mentality is able to influence voters' minds by constructing the “enduring reality” of an action programme proclaimed by a candidate. The manipulative potential of a mythologization strategy in political communication is stipulated by the fact that myths are able to impress into the public mind the delusive reality models and to legitimize a political leader's authority in the voters' perception. With the help of this or that political myth the idea of a candidate's preference over all others is often fixed in voters' minds. In the modern communication space the role of mythologizing of a political leader's image in a digital space has been enhanced, as candidate's communication through social networks, blogs, video and audio hosting, etc., allow him to interact with voters more effectively, to personalize communication, get a feedback, to influence not only the consciousness, but also the subconscious using both verbal and non-verbal means. The video materials of one of the candidates for the presidency of the Russian Federation, Vladimir Zhirinovsky, posted on You Tube video hosting in the period of 2018 presidential election campaign, are chosen as the empirical base of this research. The subject of the present research is “internal mythologization” (when a politician and his team are considered as a source of myth-making versus “external mythologization” initiated by non-affiliated representatives of different social groups) as a communicative strategy for constructing political leader's image in election time. The paper describes the specificity of the representation of four main political myths (social ideal, enemy, identity community and hero-saviour) in communication of Vladimir Zhirinovsky as the “Patriarch” of election campaigns in Russia and reveals the most significant myths for the formation of his political image. The most important concepts representing this or that myth are identified, the ways of their explication (verbal and visual, explicit and implicit) are revealed. An analysis of mythologization methods of V. Zhirinovsky's image, a candidate, who was running for president post for the sixth time on presidential election 2018, was compared to the mythologization methods of Pavel Grudinin's image as a new candidate for the Russian political agenda. The conducted analysis allowed to reveal the main characteristics of political leader's image mythologization in election period, namely - ideological charge and manipulativity, most clearly manifested in a candidate's communication in digital space.",,978-1-7281-1584-9,10.1109/COMSDS.2019.8709654,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8709654,communication strategy;election campaign;political myth;image;internal mythologization;external mythologization;manipulation;ideological bias;digital environment,Voting;Electron tubes;YouTube;Blogs;Media;Mood,,2,,15,IEEE,9-May-19,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

The previous approaches perform political analysis used social media data mainly focused on analyzing only textual data for the two-party system. However, the social media engagement, i.e. posts reaction, of political supporters can be used to identify the most influential political party. Therefore, to explore the content of social media political campaigns and to identify the most influential political party using social engagement in a multi-party system, we extracted Facebook data using Facebook Graph API for the three most popular political parties in Pakistan, i.e. PTI, PML-N and, PPP. The results reported that PTI relies more on the English language when compared with PML-N and PTI. However, video content is most prominently used by all three parties. The ratio of reactions on Facebook posts varies, PTI has received the highest number of “LIKE” and “SHARE”, PML-N, and PPP has received the major number of “HAHA” and “SAD”. PTI appears as the most influential party in comparison with PML-N and PPP. The influence score for each party appeared in accordance with the results of Pakistan's General Elections 2018. Hence, the proposed influence score irrespective of party-system can be used by researchers to improve the accuracy of electoral prediction.

The creation of an online community, management of Internet content (targeting), and neuro-visual modeling of the perception of information products should become modern tools for interaction between political parties and electoral groups. Modern Russian parliamentary political parties have managed to create formal digital infrastructures (official Internet representations and social media pages), but have not made them functional and effective.

National personalities and elongated election seasons inundated with negative campaigning may have ""turned-off"" potential voters, but as the popular aphorism goes, ""all politics are local,"" and thus local conditions should be interrogated to help understand voting and other forms of political participation. To this end, this study seeks to probe more deeply into this phenomenon by examining local political participation in the American states. For reasons we outline below, we specifically focus on local political participation in the state of Tennessee (TN) Utilizing data from the 2016 Congressional Cooperative Election Study (CCE), we ask what local-level factors most likely influence political participation among Blacks in TN? In order to parse through the large 2016 CCES dataset more efficiently, we employ software programming tools to address our primary questions using computational thinking and research methods. This technology-driven style of political thinking demonstrates the utility of adopting computing tools and data-driven approaches to identify and address areas of concern across government and civic society.

Social media platforms play an instrumental role in election campaigns and other political debates, as reported in past studies. Despite the growing number of studies concerning the role of social media in elections, little attention has been paid to Africa's largest democracy (Nigeria); this motivates our study. For the study, we collected a large number of tweets based on the Twitter handles of the political parties and presidential candidates. We measured the online activities of political parties and candidates and analysed users' opinions to understand their sentiments. Moreover, we used differential sentiment analysis to study the relationship between the opinions of the users and the information produced by the 12 top Nigerian news media outlets. We apply a novel method of reverse engineering of Twitter accounts to understand the online campaign strategies of the parties. We found that while both the ruling party and minority parties concentrate on promoting their candidates, the top opposition party plays a two-way strategy of promoting their candidates while attacking the ruling party and its candidate. Finally, compared to the actual election results, our Twitter analysis correctly predicts the winner in 24 states out of the 37 states (including the Federal Capital Territory).

It includes both rational and socio-psychological factors in the behavior of the protesters. An analytical study of the simplified form of the model (without a network structure) leads to two main findings. First, a protest campaign unfolds successfully, reaching a significant number of participants, only if it overcomes a certain turnout threshold before the start of repression. Second, there exists a critical level of repression's severity, at which the protest campaign will not survive, regardless of the initial number of participants. This threshold occurs when individuals have a relatively high level of risk aversion. A computational experiment has shown that its existence and value do not depend on the network topologies, traditionally explored in the literature - namely Watts-Strogatz, Barabási-Albert, and regular graph. Yet an experiment has also demonstrated that this “repression barrier” can be overcome by more specialized network structures.

This research aims to investigate the basis upon which voters cast their votes, specifically examining whether emotional sentiment or considerations of long-term development play a significant role. The study utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and relies on a dataset comprising videos of campaigns converted into text featuring speeches made by candidates from the parties under consideration. NLP techniques are used to gain insight into voters' decision-making processes and determine their inclination towards emotional sentiment versus long-term development. The analysis involves cleaning the speech text, followed by sentiment analysis to assess the positivity and negativity expressed by the candidates. Furthermore, topic modeling is performed to identify the themes discussed in the speeches. This research found that voters tend to cast their votes by considering the candidates' long-term development plans and positive attitudes.

To this end, we gathered thousands of Twitter messages mentioning political parties and their leaders posted several weeks before and after the 2019 Spanish presidential election. We then followed a twofold analysis strategy: (1) statistical characterization using indices derived from well-known temporal and information metrics and methods –including entropy, mutual information, and the Compounded Aggregated Positivity Index– allowing the estimation of changes in the density function of sentiment data; and (2) feature extraction from nonlinear intrinsic patterns in terms of manifold learning using autoencoders and stochastic embeddings. The results show that both the indices and the manifold features provide an informative characterization of the sentiment dynamics throughout the election period.

Influencers of a social media network, owing to their massive popularity, provide a huge potential customer base. However, it is not straightforward to decide which influencers should be selected for an advertising campaign that can generate high returns with low investment. In this work, we present an agent-based model (ABM) that can simulate the dynamics of influencer advertising campaigns in a variety of scenarios and can help discover the best influencer marketing strategy. Our system is a probabilistic graph-based model that provides the additional advantage to incorporate real-world factors such as customers’ interest in a product, customer behavior, the willingness to pay, a brand’s investment cap, influencers’ engagement with influence diffusion, and the nature of the product being advertised, viz. luxury and non-luxury. Using customer acquisition cost and conversion ratio as a unit economic, we evaluate the performance of different kinds of influencers under a variety of circumstances that are simulated by varying the nature of the product and the customers’ interest. Our results exemplify the circumstance-dependent nature of influencer marketing and provide insights into which kinds of influencers would be a better strategy under respective circumstances. For instance, we show that as the nature of the product varies from luxury to non-luxury, the performance of celebrities declines, whereas the performance of nano-influencers improves. In terms of the customers’ interest, we find that the performance of nano-influencers declines with the decrease in customers’ interest, whereas the performance of celebrities improves.",2329-924X,,10.1109/TCSS.2022.3140779,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9689053,Agent-based modeling;influencer marketing;social networks;viral marketing,Social networking (online);Integrated circuit modeling;Advertising;Investment;Context modeling;Attenuation;Statistics,,9,,45,IEEE,21-Jan-22,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals

This is especially relevant in applications that depend on (possibly evolving) opinions, such as decision-making (the process of selecting an alternative from a set of possible options). In this work, we extend an existing communication framework of opinion dynamics in order to study the effects of mass communication, such as propaganda or advertisement campaigns. In this framework, fuzzy linguistic 2-tuples are used to represent opinions, which is a realistic representation of this qualitative information, and the communication is divided into three independent sub-processes, which represent the propagation of opinions in a more realistic manner, including a social network to represent agents' interactions and an awareness deactivation mechanism to model the awareness dynamics in the system (i.e., options for which agents have opinions). However, other sources of massive information can also influence opinions.

This research offers the findings of an investigation into the viability of using Twitter data for purposes such as monitoring public sentiment and anticipating vote preferences. To gauge public sentiment, we amassed and categorised tweets regarding government programmes using natural language processing techniques. We were able to predict the electoral fortunes of various political parties using supervised learning techniques applied to a huge dataset of tweets. Unsupervised learning methods were used to analyse the cleaned data for trends and patterns. To identify whether a tweet was positive or negative towards a candidate, we used supervised learning techniques. Our findings suggest that Twitter data can be utilised to predict the electoral fortunes of political parties and the public's reaction to policy proposals. We ran across problems like the overuse of irony and sarcasm and the usage of difficult-to-decipher jargon and lingo. Because of these obstacles, thorough data pre-treatment and analysis is required before any results can be drawn.

Social media has a clear influence on people, especially during events such as elections where recent international events have shown that social media played an important role. In fact, there are three main aspects in this digital landscape: political movements and political candidates looking for popular support (number of followers), citizens' messages discussing social issues (trending topics on social media), and political propaganda appearing in the net in favor of or against politicians or political movements (advertisement). One of the issues with social media is the presence of automatic accounts (bots) that artificially fill accounts with fake followers, create false trending topics, and share fake news or simply flood the net with propaganda. All this artificially generated information may influence people and sometimes may even censor people's real opinions undermining their freedom of speech and affecting true democracy.

Zhubanov Aktobe Regional State University, Aktobe, Kazakhstan",2020 IEEE Communication Strategies in Digital Society Seminar (ComSDS),27-May-20,2020,,,91,98,"Electoral communications in a digital environment are characterized by a low level of external control, the presence of multimedia opportunities for creating campaign messages, and the viral distribution of information about the candidate and his political program. The digital environment has powerful mobilization potential. This makes it possible to widely use the network opportunities for involving young people in the electoral process. At the same time, qualitatively new conditions are being formed for the implementation of pre-election communication, which is becoming more open, transparent, interactive. Any network user can ask a question, become a member of political discussions, leave comments, express his opinion on the candidate's personal page or on any connected Internet site. Taking into account the opinions of potential voters allows you to adjust the campaign process, make changes and clarifications in the election materials to achieve optimal voting results.In a digital environment, there are more opportunities to control and manipulate the consciousness of the electorate compared to traditional media. The purpose of manipulation is to covertly influence public consciousness, to change the social and behavioral attitudes of potential voters in a direction that is beneficial to the manipulator. Communicative strategy of manipulation is actively used to achieve optimal voting results in election campaigns. The purpose of the manipulation strategy is to covertly influence the public consciousness, to change the social and behavioral attitudes of the electorate in a direction favorable for the manipulator. Manipulation is often accomplished through myth-making. Political myths are capable of introducing into the public consciousness illusory models of the reality. In mythologized political communication knowledge of the world and an understanding of the facts of real life are replaced by images, symbols, fictions and legends. During the elections manipulation is already manifested in the myth that a politician chooses for himself. This is due to the ideological precepts of the leader and his personal characteristics. Representation of a myth is carried out using certain linguistic means and stylistic techniques that perform a manipulative function.The purpose of the study is to determine the manipulative potential of myth-making as a tool for constructing a positive image of a politician during elections, as well as to identify specific signals in the election communication of a politician, which are called “manipulation markers”.One of the objectives of the study was to identify ways of representing the main strategies for manipulating electoral communications through myth-making. The strategies for reduction, strategies for increasing and strategies for theatricalization [1, p. 53-54] are analyzed. The study showed that the reduction strategy is represented primarily with the help of the myth of the enemy (about a conspiracy), the increasing strategy with the myth of the hero-savior, and the theatricalization strategy with the myths of the social ideal and of identity (unity).The empirical basis of the study was 142 videos of three candidates for the post of President of the Russian Federation (Pavel Grudinin, Vladimir Zhirinovsky and Ksenia Sobchak) containing elements of mythology. These videos were posted on YouTube video hosting during the 2018 presidential election campaign.The methods used are discourse analysis, content analysis, linguo-ideological and linguo-stylistic analysis of media text. The authors identified lexical, grammatical and stylistic markers of manipulation. These markers can be used by IT specialists in the development of computer software to determine the level of manipulativeness of the pre-election media text. The pilot project of such a software was recently developed by the team of the Laboratory of Applied Linguistics and Cognitive Research of the Siberian Federal University [2]. The authors show that the selection of manipulation markers depends on many factors, which include not only the type of discourse and the scope of the text, but also the subject of the text, the language in which communication is carried out, as well as extralinguistic factors that take into account the type of author, type of addressee, situation, time, place, etc.",,978-1-7281-6441-0,10.1109/ComSDS49898.2020.9101306,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9101306,electoral communication;digital politics;manipulation strategy;manipulation markers;digital environment,Voting;Manipulators;Electric potential;Media;Linguistics;Videos;Internet,,5,,31,IEEE,27-May-20,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences
How biased are American media outlets? A framework for presentation bias regression,M. Tran,"Institute for Creative Technologies, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA",2020 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data),19-Mar-21,2020,,,4359,4364,"Media bias is a pressing issue in our society that can increase political polarization. To address the issue, previous studies mainly develop supervised learning models to identify bias at the article level, which not only requires expensive data collection but also careful features selection. An alternative approach to combat media bias focuses on the source level, which can help news aggregators promptly filter unreliable news based on their sources. Despite being a promising approach, the detection of biases at the source level remains largely unexplored. In this study, we propose a novel unsupervised framework to estimate presentation bias of news sources. The framework first uses a retrieval engine to form groups of related articles, then constructs pairwise biases between news sources using Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) and finally, assigns bias scores for each source with a graph-based algorithm. Using a dataset of approximately 83K articles from 14 news sources, we validate the results of our framework with 3 benchmarks and find that our approach can provide reliable bias ratings, with a Pearson correlation coefficient of up to 0.92. We further discuss the possibility of extending the framework to identify selection bias.",,978-1-7281-6251-5,10.1109/BigData50022.2020.9377987,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9377987,politics;media bias;sentiment analysis,Sentiment analysis;Supervised learning;Pressing;Media;Big Data;Feature extraction;Reliability,,,,30,IEEE,19-Mar-21,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

Second, use the Dictionary of Concerned Citizens which contains German political language of the right and the far right, to analyze the data with methods of text mining and social network analysis, and afterwards we display the results in a network of words of Concerned Citizen Communication Style (CCCS).",,978-1-7281-2946-4,10.1109/SNAMS.2019.8931814,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8931814,populism;communication style;election;text mining;social media,Voting;Twitter;Text mining;Security;Dictionaries;Media,,,,46,IEEE,16-Dec-19,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences
Don?t Trust #CDNMedia: Twitter Posts From Eight Canadian Communities During #elxn42,J.

Part of a global trend, local news outlets in Canada are closing faster than new ones spring up to replace them [51]. This trend is concerning in light of a report by the Knight Commission [46], which described the availability of local information as something which is ""as vital to the healthy functioning of communities as clean air, safe streets, good schools, and public health"" [46]. When the news being shared is political in nature, one can argue that it is uniquely vital to society, as political news helps citizens make informed decisions, particularly during election time [46]. As traditional media outlets close, and particularly in light of recent Facebook algorithm changes, many people turn to alternative sources of news, like Twitter to find out about current and politically relevant information in their communities [36], [58]. This trend presents us with questions: Does Twitter currently function as an alternative political news source for communities outside major media centers, particularly when traditional news outlets are being closed?

In response to this threat, online advertising networks have started making political advertising on their platforms more transparent in order to enable third parties to detect malicious advertisers. We present a set of methodologies and perform a security analysis of Facebook's U.S. Ad Library, which is their political advertising transparency product. Unfortunately, we find that there are several weaknesses that enable a malicious advertiser to avoid accurate disclosure of their political ads. We also propose a clustering-based method to detect advertisers engaged in undeclared coordinated activity. Our clustering method identified 16 clusters of likely inauthentic communities that spent a total of over four million dollars on political advertising. This supports the idea that transparency could be a promising tool for combating disinformation.

The methodology uses an automatic incremental procedure based on feed-forward neural networks for analyzing the posts published by social media users. Starting from a limited set of classification rules, created from a small subset of hashtags that are notoriously in favor of specific factions, the methodology iteratively generates new classification rules. Such rules are then used to determine the polarization of people towards a faction. The methodology has been assessed on two case studies that analyze the polarization of a large number of Twitter users during the 2018 Italian general election and 2016 US presidential election. The achieved results are very close to the real ones and more accurate than the average of the opinion polls, revealing the high accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed approach.

To address this gap, we conduct a comprehensive investigation, focusing on the nuanced distinctions both qualitatively and quantitatively in the framing of social media and traditional media outlets concerning a series of American Supreme Court rulings on affirmative action, student loans, and abortion rights. Our findings reveal that, while some overlap in framing exists between social media and traditional media outlets, substantial differences emerge both across various topics and within specific framing categories. Compared to traditional news media, social media platforms tend to present more polarized stances across all framing categories. Further, we observe significant polarization in the news media’s treatment (i.e., Left vs. Right leaning media) of affirmative action and abortion rights, whereas the topic of student loans tends to exhibit a greater degree of consensus.

Digital Manipulation and the Future of Electoral Democracy in the U.S.,G. P. Zachary,"School for the Future of Innovation, Arizona State University, Tempe, USA",IEEE Transactions on Technology and Society,3-Jun-20,2020,1,2,104,112,"This article examines the problem of unreliable information on the Web and its implications for the integrity of elections, and representative democracy, in the U.S. Effects of digital disinformation campaigns on voters are hard to quantify because understanding voter behavior is notoriously difficult for scholars and politicians alike. But false digital information does seem to influence voter behavior by amplifying negative attitudes and heightening fears. One rational response is to advocate for standards of veracity for digital information, but the challenges to imposing new standards are at least twofold. First, “useful fictions” have been found to sometimes engender beneficial effects; so flatly banning digital falsehoods would seem undesirable. Second, emerging “deepfake” technologies may worsen the problem of digital dissembling. One consolation is the persistent uncertainty about whether video and other forms of digital manipulation influence voters in predictable ways, reducing the perceived value of the practice. The surest remedy may be a “technological fix,” inserted into public digital platforms, which can identify instances of maliciously false information, and either quickly destroy or isolate them. Yet no single actor-neither governments, nor “Big Tech” corporations, nor individual citizens or their voluntary associations-can introduce and maintain such a “fix.” Partnerships are needed in order to sustain robust remedies.

The research questions answered throughout this paper are two: the first one wonders if the Lebanese society and government are aware of the e-waste hazards and whether there is any action taken, on the governmental level, to avert an environmental catastrophe. Whereas the second one is concerned with finding out, what Lebanese think about e-waste and whether they are willing to fight against it? Answers to the first question resulted from interviews. The authors have visited Company A and NGO B, the first is concerned with collecting waste in greater Beirut while the second aims at spreading awareness to e-waste's dangers on governmental and social levels alike. Question two was discussed throughout surveys filled by random individuals from Lebanese society. The answers to both research questions came in a way that proves both hypotheses assumed at the beginning of the research, namely that e-waste poses a great threat to the Lebanese environment and that laws must be implemented to regulate collection and disposal of electronic appliances; also, e-cycling initiatives must be encouraged to reduce the quantities of generated e-waste.

This paper proposes a novel model for inserting advertisement into online video that considers content and commercial specific properties while optimizing Quality of Experience (QoE) by estimating suitable duration for advertisement, number of splits and content relation. The proposed model has been evaluated in a controlled on-line video test environment so that the success rate of this platform has been compared with the advertisement insertion strategies of technology frontrunners YouTube and Vimeo. In terms of medium and long length online videos, advertisements located within the content provides a better QoE compared to the ones that are located at the beginning of the video.

An advertising strategy is a combination of multiple targeting options, and its performance is tied strictly to the combination as a whole.

Therefore, constraints of non-combinatorial exploration and non-autoregressive generation have to be met.

Since 2010, presidential campaigns in Indonesia have extensively used social media networks as a standard form of presidential communication. However, the presidential candidate's campaign duration has not been maximized to convey the vision and mission to prospective voters. This study aims to identify each candidate's focus based on tweet analysis using Improved K-Means and a second-level normalization algorithm. The data consisted of 2,786 tweets from January to April 2019, obtained from two sources: 1,485 tweets from candidate#1 and 1,301 tweets from candidate#2. The results show that there are 16 clusters created from candidate#1 and 14 from others. Most candidate#1 aligns with its mission. Consequently, our study could clarify the presidential candidate's mission focus. The more frequently the mission is discussed on social media, the more notable it is as the President's primary work program. The first candidate's tweets mainly mentioned the fourth mission, and the second one was about the first mission. Furthermore, there is a link between the frequency of tweets from the presidential candidate's mission and the theme of the presidential debate.",,978-1-6654-5512-1,10.1109/ISRITI56927.2022.10052929,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10052929,campaign;k-means;mission;presidential election;tweet,Seminars;Social networking (online);Space missions;Blogs;Clustering algorithms;Intelligent systems;Information technology;Standards,,,,35,IEEE,7-Mar-23,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences
Analyzing Complex Contagion Effects in Donation Diffusion: A Hybrid Network Science and Neural Network Approach,P. Ghanemipour; A.

In contrast to simple contagion, which is associated with the transmission of viruses, complex contagion involves a more intricate process of influence, making multiple exposures to certain behaviors or actions necessary before an individual adopts them. In this context, the dynamics of complex contagion are in the domain of financial contribution to presidential campaigns from 2000 to 2012 cycles. The study uncovers the factors shaping the decision-making process of potential donors. The number of exposures to donors exhibits an unexpected negative correlation with the likelihood of an individual contributing to a presidential campaign. On the other hand, the amount of money the connected donors to potential contributions made seems to influence predicting their chance to donate. In addition to making donations, many donors are shown to be already influenced to contribute to a presidential candidate, and investing time and resources in them will be unnecessary for advertising. Therefore, it can be more beneficial for campaigns to increase the quantity of each contribution instead of finding various donors to gain influence on their relations.",,979-8-3503-8158-0,10.1109/DCHPC60845.2024.10454079,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10454079,Complex Contagion;Information Diffusion;Network Science;Neural Network;Political Science,Ethics;Voting;High performance computing;Neural networks;Graph theory;Behavioral sciences;Information diffusion,,,,20,IEEE,6-Mar-24,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

This paper performs a comprehensive analysis of the exposure of users to ads and advertisers using a dataset, including more than 7M ads from 140k unique advertisers delivered to more than 5k users, which was collected between October 2016 and May 2018. This paper focuses on Facebook, which is the second largest advertising platform next only to Google in terms of revenue and accounts for more than 2.2B monthly active users. Our analysis reveals that the Facebook users are exposed (in median) to 70 ads per week, which comes from 12 advertisers. Ads represent between 10% and 15% of all the information received in the users' newsfeed. A small increment of 1% in the portion of ads in the newsfeed could roughly represent a revenue increase of 8.17M USD per week for Facebook.

Creating Technology Worthy of the Human Spirit,A. Van Noppen,"Mobius, San Geronimo, CA, USA",Journal of Social Computing,31-Jan-22,2021,2,4,309,322,"Spiritual caretakers have been present in every culture throughout human history. We know them as ministers, rabbis, llamas, shamans, imams, chaplains, gurus, and wise elders. In modern, secular times, they also include therapists, social workers, meditation teachers, and more. These caretakers support us through birth, death, and many of the most intimate and complex parts of the human experience. They use skills honed over many years that require paying radical attention to the humanity of others. Yet where is this expertise to be found in the creation of the digital technologies that have become portals through which we live, love, learn, grieve, and connect with our communities? Those who design and build digital technology must accept that we have become de-facto spiritual caretakers with the power to treat the well-being of humanity with care or with negligence. Unfortunately, caretaking is a role that computer science degrees do not prepare people for, few business models optimize for, and algorithms can not easily solve. This article outlines two concrete best practices that can help foster genuine responsibility and care on the part of technologists and technology companies. First, technologists must recognize that what we create is an expression of our own inner state. Our spiritual and emotional health is inextricably linked with our ability to build technology with responsibility and wisdom. Second, technologists must create an empowered seat at the table for those with the expertise and orientation needed to care for our souls, whether from a religious or secular lens.",2688-5255,,10.23919/JSC.2021.0024,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9698153,spirituality;ethics;well-being;humane technology,Measurement;Computer science;Social computing;Ethics;Biological system modeling;Ecosystems;Regulation,,5,,42,,31-Jan-22,,,TUP,TUP Journals

Despite the wide range of topics and business fields covered by current hackathons, a lot of events lack female participants. The lack of gender diversity is a problem, as diversity is a well-known and significant contributor to idea generation, innovativeness, and the efficiency of making novel development. This article covered the current literature, identifying the reasons why women show low interest in hackathon participation. Among these reasons, there is impostor syndrome caused by gender stereotypes, the difference between male and female experiences, for example in video games, as well as the undeserved bad reputation of hackathons as sleepless events, aimed only for specialists and guru programmers. However, hackathon organizers have found positive experiences of attracting more women to their events by implementing female-inclusive measures. Based on the literature, we have compiled recommendations to be considered and implemented in event organizing strategies, implementation models, and promotional approaches to achieve better gender balance at hackathon events.

Reputation Management as an Applied Communication Technology in Digital Society,I. A. Bykov; J. D. Akhmedova,"Chair of PR in Politics and Public Administration, St Petersburg State University, St Petersburg, Russia; Chair of PR in Politics and Public Administration, St Petersburg State University, St Petersburg, Russia",2022 Communication Strategies in Digital Society Seminar (ComSDS),9-May-22,2022,,,154,157,"This paper aims to study the advantages of reputation management as an applied science in the digital society. In Russia, the theory of reputation management has not been adopted in full. Additionally, existing publications very often tend to ignore the issue of coordinating scientific theory and current practice. At the same time, an extensive system of PR support for government authorities has been created, as well as PR in business is highly developed, especially in public corporations. However, the mentioned gap between practice and theory remains. One of the ways to overcome the current situation can be found in the use of the case study approach in education and research with application to the specific cases from among current political events. In the fall of 2021, the elections of deputies of the Gosudarstvennay Duma (Russian Parliament) were held, after which the scandal around the deputy of the Gosudarstvennay Duma from the Communist Party of the Russian Federation Valery Rashkin received a great response. The authors argue that the communication models developed within the framework of the modern theory of reputation management are applicable for the analysis of practical cases related to information attacks on basic PR subjects. A careful analysis of the case of Valery Rashkin easily reveals both general and specific factors that influenced the development of events. In particular, Rashkin’s anti-crisis communications errors include the flimsiness of the original ‘legend’, the inconsistency of the position, and the loss of support from the party. The informational attack on Valery Rashkin was of a professional and complex nature, while not affecting the most important political aspects of the established reputation. In our opinion, we cannot talk about the rejection of scientific research and the development of theoretical knowledge in the field of reputation management. We are talking about a combination of modern theoretical approaches, effective research methods, and practice for the development of public relations in Russia. Public relations as a scientific discipline is one of the applied sciences with direct practical application. This is precisely the competitive advantage of this specialty in Russia.",2768-4873,978-1-6654-8393-3,10.1109/ComSDS55328.2022.9769117,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9769117,political PR;reputation management;image;political conflict;crisis communication,Seminars;Analytical models;Public relations;Voting;Education;Communications technology;Business,,,,17,IEEE,9-May-22,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

OSNs alter how people communicate, make decisions, and form or change their beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors. Thus, they can now impact social groups, financial systems, and political communication at scale. As one type of OSN, social media platforms, such as Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube, serve as outlets for users to convey information to an audience as broad or targeted as the user desires. Over the years, these social media platforms have been infected with automated accounts, or bots, that are capable of hijacking conversations, influencing other users, and manipulating content dissemination. Although benign bots exist to facilitate legitimate activities, we focus on bots designed to perform malicious acts through social media platforms. Bots that mimic the social behaviors of humans are referred to as social bots. Social bots help automate sociotechnical behaviors, such as “liking” tweets, tweeting/retweeting a message, following users, and coordinating with or even competing against other bots. Some advanced social bots exhibit highly sophisticated traits of coordination and communication with complex organizational structures. This article presents a detailed survey of social bots, their types and behaviors, and how they impact social media, identification algorithms, and their coordination strategies in OSNs. The survey also discusses coordination in areas such as biological systems, interorganizational networks, and coordination games.

How easily are they identified, however, when they are dormant and exhibit no measurable behavior at all, except for their silence? We identified “dormant bot networks” positioned to influence social media discourse surrounding the 2018 U.S. senate election. A dormant bot is a social media persona that does not post content yet has large follower and friend relationships with other users. These relationships may be used to manipulate online narratives and elevate or suppress certain discussions in the social media feed of users. Using a simple structure-based approach, we identify a large number of dormant bots created in 2017 that begin following the social media accounts of numerous US government politicians running for re-election in 2018. Findings from this research were used by the U.S. Government to suspend dormant bots prior to the elections to prevent any malign influence campaign.

More recently, this approach has gained increasing attention from various quarters outside the traditional remit of professionalized science, which include local governments, civil society organizations (CSOs), professional networks, and cooperatives. These entities recognize citizen science as a practical method that harnesses the collective resources of a community to address pressing local concerns and promote a robust participatory democracy. Emerging initiatives include citizen observatories, data cooperatives, and collaboration platforms. Despite the growing popularity, managing citizen science initiatives (involving numerous participants over an extended period of time) poses considerable challenges. Leaders of citizen science initiatives grapple with difficulties that appear formidable to overcome.

Unfortunately, social media platforms have notably become a politicians' tool for spreading propaganda campaigns and disparage opponents, which leads to side effects such as amplifying social discord. In order to thwart fake news, independent journalists have maintained a fact-checking organization and shared their checking results on political speeches on their website, which has raised public awareness for upholding democratic values. Meanwhile, researchers have proposed various types of machine-learning and deep-learning based approaches as well as linguistic based approaches by using various types of information for the detection of fake news. Some of them have shown promising results on the detection of fake news. However, they focused on the detection of hoaxes, hateful speech, attractive headlines, political astroturfs, and satirical news or posts. In this paper, we propose an automated framework for the detection of fake political speech. It uses different classification methods for extracting features from political speech statement and its metadata including speech subject, location, speaker's profile, speaker's credibility, and speech context information. The features are then used to train a machine learning model with automatic feature selection and parameter tuning.

For example, do gender studies contribute to the development of communication theory? Or do gender communication barriers exist and, if so, how they influence mass media? In Russia, until recently, gender has been studied mainly from political perspective and, more precisely, as a problem for public administration where gender imbalance exists. The authors aim to characterize gender communication studies in contemporary Russia. Data were collected from interviews and secondary data analysis of the Russian Science Citation Index.

Platform companies attracted huge ammount of money, allowing for a while to solve the problem of investment and supporting the financial market. The basis of this economic model is network effects produced by the integrated digital infrastructure, which contribute to monopolization and the constant expansion of platform companies in new areas. The principle of functioning of this infrastructure is the constant collection and further monetization of data extracted from the interactions of individuals with each other or with one of the elements of a digital economy or governance structures. This paper is devoted to the analysis of the logic of the emergence of “platform capitalism” as an effect of structural contradictions of neoliberalism (financialization, permanent market instability). The paper focuses on the transformation of the advertising market under the influence of platform companies, using the US example, to show the mechanism of digital disruption in print media business model. The development of digital infrastructure has allowed platform companies to collect and monetize data, deliver personalized ads to users throughout the internet. A structural shift has occurred - traditional media have ceased to be the main channels for transmitting advertising messages to certain social groups, advertising platforms are able to find them and deliver them ads on their own. In the framework of “platform capitalism”, many print media in order to survive try to transform themselves in accordance with the logic of the economic platform model (developing their website, data collection and monetization, integration into the logic of social networks).",,978-1-7281-6441-0,10.1109/ComSDS49898.2020.9101234,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9101234,digitalization;neoliberalism;platform capitalism;big data;financialization;disruptive innovation;advertising industry,Media;Advertising;Companies;Economics;Internet;Facebook;Investment,,4,,15,IEEE,27-May-20,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

The introduction of machine learning, and potentially artificial intelligence (AI), will vastly enhance capabilities for automating the reaching of mass audiences with tailored and plausible content. Consequently, they will render malicious actors even more powerful.Tools for making use of machine learning in information operations are developing at an extraordinarily rapid pace, and are becoming rapidly more available and affordable for a much wider variety of users. Until early 2018 it was assumed that the utilisation of AI methods by cyber criminals was not to be expected soon, because those methods rely on vast datasets, correspondingly vast computational power, or both, and demanded highly specialised skills and knowledge. However, in 2019 these assumptions proved invalid, as datasets and computing power were democratised and freely available tools obviated the need for special skills. It is reasonable to assume that this process will continue, transforming the landscape of deception, disinformation and influence online.This article assesses the state of AI-enhanced cyber and information operations in late 2019 and investigates whether this may represent the beginnings of substantial and dangerous trends over the next decade.

Telegram is a new cloud-messenger that is highly popular among bloggers and media in Russia and Belarus. Established by Pavel Durov in 2013, it offers secure and anonymous communication features. Anonymous communication has been studied by many scholars (Choudhury, Sharon, Watt, Zhang, etc), but it seems that more questions are left unanswered. This paper starts distinguishing anonymity from related notions of confidentiality and secrecy, privacy, and publicity. We provide some vocabulary to talk about anonymization and identification efforts by message sources and receivers. The paper highlights some of the limitations of current communication scholarship in this area such as anonymous communication strategy. The growing role of the Telegram messenger in the mass communications systems of Russia and Belarus indicates new opportunities for anonymous communication strategy in the digital society. The research methodology is based on a comparative analysis of statistical data on the audience of the leading Telegram news channels. The authors argue that the anonymous communication strategy has taken an important share of the market in both countries. In a comparative aspect, the indicators of the involvement of Telegram channels were analyzed. The main results of the study show that the use of various Telegram features both as a messenger and as a full-fledged media is constantly increasing. The intensity of the use of the messenger has increased and the variety of functions it performs has also increased.

Behavior-Based Machine Learning Approaches to Identify State-Sponsored Trolls on Twitter,S. Alhazbi,"Department of Computer Science and Engineering, College of Engineering, Qatar University, Doha, Qatar",IEEE Access,3-Nov-20,2020,8,,195132,195141,"In recent years, there has been an increased prevalence of adopting state-sponsored trolls by governments and political organizations to influence public opinion through disinformation campaigns on social media platforms. This phenomenon negatively affects the political process, causes distrust in the political systems, sows discord within societies, and hastens political polarization. Thus, there is a need to develop automated approaches to identify sponsored-troll accounts on social media in order to mitigate their impacts on the political process and to protect people against opinion manipulation. In this paper, we argue that behaviors of sponsored-troll accounts on social media are different from ordinary users' because of their extrinsic motivation, and they cannot completely hide their suspicious behaviors, therefore these accounts can be identified using machine learning approaches based solely on their behaviors on the social media platforms. We have proposed a set of behavioral features of users' activities on Twitter. Based on these features, we developed four classification models to identify political troll accounts, these models are based on decision tree, random forest, Adaboost, and gradient boost algorithms. The models were trained and evaluated on a set of Saudi trolls disclosed by Twitter in 2019, the overall classification accuracy reaches up to 94.4%. The models also are capable to identify the Russian trolls with accuracy up to 72.6% without training on this set of trolls. This indicates that although the strategies of coordinated trolls might vary from an organization to another, they are all just employees and have common behaviors that can be identified.",2169-3536,,10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3033666,Open Access; Qatar National Library; ,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9239285,State-sponsored trolls;disinformation;propaganda;behavioral pattern,Twitter;Machine learning;Government;Feature extraction;Information integrity,,7,,46,CCBY,26-Oct-20,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals

We collected our data over a set of Brexit related hashtags and searched for bot accounts by selecting strongly opinionated accounts, then analysed their strategies, intended influence and policy position on Brexit issues. There are more than 1,962 bot accounts currently engaged in the Brexit debate. Using a novel approach for reverse engineering twitter bots [5] we show how to uncover the bots' implemented strategies. We found that@StillYesScot,@IsThisABOt and@FAO_Scotbot, all bots that promote Scottish independence, use similar strategies.

Misinformation on social media platforms affects various aspects of society, including health and politics, and can take many forms, such as text and images. However, current studies mainly focus on analysing singular topics and modalities, without considering the heterogeneity of the issue. Our research aimed to examine the relationship between visual elements and engagement, as well as the relationship between sentiment analysis, hate speech, and bots on a variety of topics on the Twitter social media platform Twitter. We labelled 12,581 misinformation posts that were manually modelled into a topic hierarchy. We then analysed these posts, including their sentiments, the prevalence of hate speech, and bot activity on different topics. The results revealed that political misinformation tends to contain more hate speech than COVID-19 misinformation and that political misinformation also has a higher number of bots. Furthermore, the findings suggest that misinformation online with more than 40% negative sentences can have a high level of hate speech identified for both tweets and replies. This study provides detailed information on topics and the volume of misinformation on social media platforms, and the findings can be used to develop more advanced detection systems and support further analysis.

However, without specific knowledge of underlying facts and disparate valid perspectives of a given issue, it is hard to detect subversive intent in a generic sense. To address this, we approach the problem from a “macro” perspective. Rather than asking whether a specific social media account is acting subversively, we look at the entire discourse around a trending topic, and ask whether the discourse looks “healthy” or is it showing signs of getting hijacked or dominated by one particular perspective. To do this, we break down a social discourse into its constituent narratives. Narratives are in turn modeled as latent stories or worldviews, whose visible characterizations are in the form of specific distributions over different opinions expressed in the discourse. Once the discourse is broken down into narratives, the “health” of the discourse can be addressed using various measures, such as the relative sizes of its constituent narratives, sentiment polarity of internarrative interactions, and presence or absence of dominant players within each narrative. We conduct experiments on several well-known trending topics on Twitter to identify its constituent narratives and provide a report card on the overall discourse quality. We also show how this top-down approach offers the means to delineate roles played by users as drivers of the discourse, the constituent narratives, or their component opinions, determined on the basis of dominance centrality measures and narrative affinities.",2329-924X,,10.1109/TCSS.2020.3009474,"Ministry of Electronics and IT (MeitY), Government of India; Machine Intelligence and Robotics Center (MINRO), Department of Information Technology and Biotechnology (ITBT), Government of Karnataka; ",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9153834,Narratives;online social cognition;opinion drivers and narrative drivers;social discourse,Cognition;Tagging;Analytical models;Twitter;Stakeholders;Predictive models,,6,,74,IEEE,31-Jul-20,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals

Unfortunately, there are many factors involving in deciding whether to take the vaccine, especially from the cultural point of view. To obtain these goals, we design a novel culture-aware machine learning (ML) model, based on our new data collection, for predicting vaccination willingness. We further analyze the most important features which contribute to the ML model's predictions using advanced AI explainers such as the Probabilistic Graphical Model (PGM) and Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP). These analyses reveal the key factors that most likely impact the vaccine adoption decisions. Our findings show that Hispanic and African American are most likely impacted by cultural characteristics such as religions and ethnic affiliation, whereas the vaccine trust and approval influence the Asian communities the most. Our results also show that cultural characteristics, rumors, and political affiliation are associated with increased vaccine rejection.",1938-1883,978-1-5386-7462-8,10.1109/ICC45041.2023.10279325,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10279325,COVID-19;Social Network,COVID-19;Analytical models;Pandemics;Machine learning;Predictive models;Data collection;Data models,,2,,18,IEEE,23-Oct-23,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

Even when considering that substantial public support, many end users were (at the time of writing, in February 2023) still facing energy affordability issues. At that time, it was not possible to foresee the end and whether an unprecedented scenario of a period of sustained high prices could repeat itself. However, what the energy crisis showed was that although it was a gas crisis, the current regulatory power market compound proved to be fragile to political interference.

To verify such hypothesis, we established ideological similarity between the elected deputies to the 2015-2018 legislature by creating a network based on their voting patterns, and used Louvain's Method to divide it into communities, which represented the ideological groups these deputies belonged to. Then, after assessing the quality of the communities split with metrics like Modularity, Party Discipline and Neighborhood Overlap, we analyzed how the deputies who were recipients of donations from three big companies - Ita ' u, ArcelorMittal, and Copersucar - distributed themselves in these communities throughout this period.

This effect is even more pronounced for geographically and culturally distant regions, for which no firsthand experience is available. To avoid information overload, news outlets typically filter the available news from foreign countries based on the expected interest of the target audiences. Such filtering imposes an inherent bias in the reporting and can create a distorted perception of a region among the consumers of news of other regions. This might lead to misunderstandings between countries and unsubstantiated political and individual decisions (e.g., in the context of migration). In this article, we systematically analyze the bias created in news reports. We consider Europe, or more precisely the European Union (EU) as our zone of concern, and examine its image in the media (news outlets) of other regions, Europe(NON-EU), Africa, Asia, Middle-East, America, and Oceania.

To tackle this challenge, our research focuses on developing a detection framework for identifying political images crafted from similar templates, which are a common tool in such propaganda efforts. During a national referendum held in 2021 in Taiwan, we collected visual content from various social networks and implemented a hybrid approach that combines object recognition, textual analysis, and pixel-level information. This methodology is specifically designed to detect patterns and similarities within propaganda images, enabling us to trace and analyze the potentially manipulative content. Our hybrid feature combination technique has demonstrated superior performance compared to several established baseline methods in identifying template-based images.

By consolidating publicly available data from the House of Representatives and the Superior Electoral Court (TSE), we construct a dataset containing elected congressmen, campaign donors and donations, and legal bills and votes. This leads to the donation network (edges represent co-donation) and voting network (edges represent co-voting) in which nodes are congressmen. We examine homophily and cohesion of congressmen in these two networks with respect to their political parties and electoral regions. Our results indicate that regions exhibit stronger homophily than political parties in the donation network, while this trend is opposite for the voting network. In this sense, we find that partisan cohesion is strong and diverse in the voting network, while regional cohesion is consistently negligible.

The players must decide on the budget distribution among the individuals at a finite number of campaign times to maximize their overall payoff as a function of individuals’ opinions. Under some assumptions, we show that i) the optimal investment strategy for a single player can be found in polynomial time by solving a concave program, and ii) the open-loop equilibrium strategies for the multiplayer dynamic game can be computed efficiently by following natural regret-minimization dynamics.

In this paper, we investigate the problem of measuring time-sensitive and topic-specific influence based on streaming texts and dynamic social networks. A user’s influence can change rapidly in response to a new event and vary on different topics. For example, the political influence of Douglas Jones increased dramatically after winning the Alabama special election, and then rapidly decreased after the election week. During the same period, however, Douglas Jones’ influence on sports remained low. Most existing approaches can only model the influence based on static social network structures and topic distributions. Furthermore, as popular social networking services embody many features to connect their users, multi-typed interactions make it hard to learn the roles that different interactions play when propagating information. To address these challenges, we propose a Time-sensitive and Topic-specific Influence Measurement (TTIM) method, to jointly model the streaming texts and dynamic social networks. We simulate the influence propagation process with a self-attention mechanism to learn the contributions of different interactions and track the influence dynamics with a matrix-adaptive long short-term memory. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to measure time-sensitive and topic-specific influence. Furthermore, the TTIM model can be easily adapted to supporting online learning which consumes constant training time on newly arrived data for each timestamp. We comprehensively evaluate the proposed TTIM model on five datasets from Twitter and Reddit. The experimental results demonstrate promising performance compared to the state-of-the-art social influence analysis models and the potential of TTIM in visualizing influence dynamics and topic distribution.",2169-3536,,10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2991683,"National Institutes of Health(grant numbers:U01HG008488); National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases(grant numbers:R56AI125105,7R01AI132030); National Institute of Mental Health(grant numbers:5R01MH106415); ",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9083959,Social influence;time-sensitive;topic-specific;LSTM;self-attention,Tensors;Twitter;Voting;Data models;Training;Adaptation models,,18,,43,CCBY,1-May-20,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals

Typically, campaigns are performed through instrumented accounts, known as troll accounts; despite their prominence, however, little work has been done to detect these accounts in the wild. In this paper, we present TROLLMAGNIFIER, a detection system for troll accounts. Our key observation, based on analysis of known Russian-sponsored troll accounts identified by Reddit, is that they show loose coordination, often interacting with each other to further specific narratives. Therefore, troll accounts controlled by the same actor often show similarities that can be leveraged for detection. TROLLMAGNIFIER learns the typical behavior of known troll accounts and identifies more that behave similarly. We train TROLLMAGNIFIER on a set of 335 known troll accounts and run it on a large dataset of Reddit accounts. Our system identifies 1,248 potential troll accounts; we then provide a multi-faceted analysis to corroborate the correctness of our classification. In particular, 66% of the detected accounts show signs of being instrumented by malicious actors (e.g., they were created on the same exact day as a known troll, they have since been suspended by Reddit, etc.). They also discuss similar topics as the known troll accounts and exhibit temporal synchronization in their activity. Overall, we show that using TROLLMAGNIFIER, one can grow the initial knowledge of potential trolls provided by Reddit by over 300%.",2375-1207,978-1-6654-1316-9,10.1109/SP46214.2022.9833706,National Research Centre; ,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9833706,,Privacy;Social networking (online);Instruments;Media;Assistive technologies;Behavioral sciences;Synchronization,,15,,77,IEEE,27-Jul-22,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

Despite its popularity and convenience, social media has been criticized for contributing to societal and ideological polarization as the result of trapping users in an echo chamber and filter bubbles. An emerging line of research focuses on ways to redesign content or link recommendation algorithms to mitigate the polarization phenomenon. However, existing works mainly concentrate on node-level balancing, while omitting the balancing effect that can be incurred by edge interaction in social networks. In this article, we take the first step to study the problem (CoAM) that assuming two campaigns are present in a network, how we should select seeds for each so as to maximize the interaction/activity between the followers of two campaigns (co-activity) after the diffusion process is finished. We begin our analysis by showing the hardness of CoAM under two diffusion models that are generalized from wildly used diffusion models and its objective function is neither submodular nor supermodular. This encourages us to design a submodular function that acts as a lower bound to the objective, by exploiting which we are able to devise a greedy algorithm with a provable approximation guarantee. To overcome the #P-hardness of diffusion calculation, we further extend the notion of random reverse-reachable (RR) set to devise a scalable instantiation of our approximation algorithm.

We propose a Maximum Likelihood Estimator based on a simplified Bernoulli ad delivery model. We first test our inference method through controlled ad experiments on Facebook. Then, to further investigate the potential and limitations of collaborative ad transparency, we propose a simulation framework that allows varying key parameters. We validate that our framework gives accuracies consistent with real-world observations such that the insights from our simulations are transferable to the real world. We then perform an extensive simulation study for ad campaigns that target a combination of two attributes.

Many messaging protocols—including, surprisingly, modern email— contain digital signatures which definitively tie the author to their message. If stolen or leaked, these signatures make it impossible to deny authorship. As illustrated by events surrounding leaks from Hilary Clinton’s 2016 U.S. presidential campaign, this concern has proven well founded. Deniable protocols are meant to avoid this very outcome, letting politicians and dissidents alike safely disavow authorship.

The Commission on Elections has granted external sources like the media and verified non-government organizations access to election returns. The local media relies on its parent firm for data on the local mayoral contest to keep track of the votes. The general public relies on radio broadcasts and social media live streams for election results, but voting information, particularly the map, lacks precise graphical representations of votes. The researchers opted to design and implement a web-based system for automating the visual display of the mayoral campaign election. In this project, the quick application development technique was used. With less time, the development was rapid enough to construct a prototype on how to graphically portray the voting results by leveraging Google cloud infrastructure, open source, and PHP web technologies. The local media partner was amazed by the technology during the proposal and completely supports the data to be obtained from the COMELEC, such as the number of registered voters by barangay and municipality. During testing, the ease of encoding and verification was evident. As a consequence, broadcasts of recent vote information, including the barangays, are now faster and more exact, provided in graphical form (charts, graphs, and geographical maps) until the end of the election period. Thus, geospatial mapping is an excellent method for showing election results. Furthermore, this research significantly solves the main problem of producing detailed graphical presentations of election results by developing web applications with geovisualization that can be used for smart cities and municipalities addressing the Fourth Industrial Revolution and fostering innovation. The utilization of internet technologies and comprehensive voting information has considerably boosted the community's faith and trust in the voting process.",,978-1-6654-6855-8,10.1109/GCAT55367.2022.9971959,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9971959,Election Monitoring System;Geospatial Mapping;Rapid Application Development;Web-based Application,Technological innovation;Visualization;Smart cities;Social networking (online);Voting;Media;Geospatial analysis,,,,15,IEEE,12-Dec-22,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

In this paper, we investigate how the opinion-forming process evolves over social networks under the media influence. In addition to being affected by the opinions of their connected peers, the media cooperate and/or compete mutually with each other. Networks with mixed cooperative and competitive interactions are said to be coopetitive. In this endeavor, a novel mathematical model of opinion dynamics is introduced, which captures the information diffusion process under consideration, makes use of the community-based network structure, and takes into account personalized biases among individuals in social networks. By employing port-Hamiltonian system theory to analyze the modeled opinion dynamics, we predict how public opinions evolve in the long run through social entities and find applications in political strategy science. A key technical observation is that as a result of the port-Hamiltonian formulation, the mathematical passivity property of individuals' self-dynamics facilitates the convergence analysis of opinion evolution. We explain how to steer public opinions towards consensus, polarity, or neutrality, and investigate how an autocratic media coalition might emerge regardless of public views.

With the introduction of 5G, promising high peak download speeds as well as high-power beams, there is a need to revisit traditional measurement approaches. ICNIRP, a.k.a the International Committee on Non-Ionising Radiation Protection, offers a useful guideline to evaluate the electromagnetic field exposure of living tissues and provides some limits to keep exposure well below the threshold where it is considered harmful. However, modern packet radio technologies such as 5G or Wi-Fi are different from old broadcasting technologies. They deliver high power in very short bursts, spread over a wide band, thus increasing the difficulty of measuring electric fields with traditional instruments, such as spectrum analyzers. In addition, 5G promises a high spatial focusing performance, which means that the field can vary significantly even in a small area. Hence, measurements with a higher spatial density than we can achieve with expensive and bulky spectrum analyzers are urgently needed. Software-defined radios (SDRs), as a size- and cost-efficient alternative, can be used to capture signals in the time domain and thus increase measurement accuracy. However, software-defined radios are not designed to be used as RF power meters. They require accurate calibration and data analysis to ensure the measured power is correct. The aim of this work is to provide a general framework to calibrate SDRs, enabling them to measure RF power and extract the corresponding electric field value. Subsequently, the influence of the SDR parameters on the accuracy of the electric field measurement is investigated. To assess the performance of the proposed calibration framework in a real-life scenario, we rely on our private 5G network with a calibrated SDR to measure the RF power from a 5G network.

This is a need for each of us, with its own combination of virtues and vices. Today fake news and disinformation have been a major issue causing across the globe. Creating an algorithm with great accuracy would also be a surprise, as it will have a humongous effect on the prevailing social issues as well as on the real-time political scene. Social networking and web news stories act as the primary source of news and statistics for people because it can be quickly viewed, has a low budget cost and is accessible only one click away immediately. It has so many negative impacts, though, including no verification of the origins or credibility and legitimacy of the views shown. Therefore, we have suggested a new approach for the identification of false news that incorporates empathy as an important function to improve accuracy. It also looks at the efficiency of the approach proposed using different data sets. The result suggests that the solution suggested is working well. In addition, the distinction between the structures is often carefully observed and analysed. News aggregators have the capacity to handle the load of tremendous volumes of regular produced news inputs. However, many of such systems mainly concentrate on finding and showing the common floating news, yet are unable to express the generalist opinion on the same. Different news media outlets give biased news on which different people will have multiple views. This might result in negative effects. So, to help in this question we provide a broad range to news topics which are divided into different main headings or major topics. By giving these a person can have a diverse news understanding on the same topic. Previously the news was taken only from mainstream news channels. And due to this, some news is heavily highlighted than the others as per the media bias. In older models, there were a lot of shortcomings. We address these shortcomings and we have made a few changes. We have included a bigger data set with multiple new additions such as emoticons, city, country, intensifiers and abbreviations. We would be using tweets as a main source for tweets along with traditional news sources. The most popular tweet with the maximum number of retweets is selected and categorised. From those, we then find a keyword particularly use in similar topical tweets. Based on these tweets we prepare a list of top twenty tweets and after that, we compare them with the news media outlets to verify and confirm their content. Once that is done, we create a matrix. This matrix is based on the user analysis and their reaction to that particular post. Then a graph is created based on multiple users input and this graph is analysed.

Sensitivity of Voter Turnouts in Presidential Elections – A Retrospective Analysis,K. S. Sankar,"Enloe High School, USA",2021 IEEE Integrated STEM Education Conference (ISEC),29-Apr-22,2021,,,242,242,"Voter turnout is a major swaying factor in presidential elections. One of the main missions of presidential campaigns is to rile up their political base and independents to come to the voting booths and vote for them. An important comparison is the 2016 and 2020 elections. In the 2016 election, the democrats (Clinton) won the popular vote but the republicans (Trump) managed to win more key states and won the Electoral College, and the presidency. However, in 2020, the democrats energized were smarter about campaigning and put lots of effort in increasing voter turnout in key swing states. In fact, the republicans voter turnout in 2020 increased by 17.84% in relation to 2016, but democrats increased their voter turnout by 23.43%, which allowed the democrats to win the presidency. This indicates understanding sensitivity of voter turnouts and how it affects the Electoral College is an integral part to predicting which candidate will win the presidential election. There are many minor and major factors that can significantly alter voter turnout for both parties. The objective of this research project is to understand what affects voter turnout and by how much it affects the outcome in key battleground states. Towards this, I have analyzed the 2016 election in R to understand which states had the closest elections. My analysis of percentage difference between the 2 parties’ votes at national scale shows the strategies by both parties at the county level. The republicans campaigned for the more rural areas and won many more counties than the democrats in key battleground states. On the contrary, the democrats campaigned primarily in urban and populous areas, thereby winning the popular vote but not the Electoral College. Another big factor behind the republicans’ win was that the republicans won most of the battleground states (Michigan, Florida, and North Carolina) by a close margin. All of these states had the closest margins in 2016 with Michigan being the closest state that year. Out of the top 10 closest state electoral colleges the republicans won 6 of them (102 electoral colleges) and the democrats only won 4 of them (23 electoral colleges). This analysis shows how important it is to focus campaigning in key counties relevant to their base and also sway independents towards their candidates. I intend on continuing this analysis of voter sensitivity by going through all of the elections in the 2000s. I plan to develop an analysis interface which can take user inputs to analyze the past elections. These user inputs can be a list of past close state Electoral College outcomes or it can be a change in voter turnout indicated by percentage increase/decrease towards a party in key battleground states. I also intend to analyze correlation patterns between voter turnouts and key socio-economic indicators (e.g., employment, economy and crisis). This way we can analyze the change of the close battleground states and use recent events to determine what is having the biggest impact on voter sensitivity.

#StopHateForProfit and the ethics of boycotting by corporations,T. M. Lechterman; R. Jenkins; B. J.

In June 2020, numerous companies that advertise on social media platforms withdrew their business, citing failures of the platforms (especially Facebook) to address the proliferation of hateful content [1]. Many were inspired by the #StopHateForProfit campaign initiated by the Anti-Defamation League. These events invite reflection on an understudied topic: the ethics of boycotting by corporations. Although value-driven consumerism has generated significant recent discussion in applied ethics, that discussion has focused almost exclusively on the consumption choices of individuals. As this paper underscores, value-driven consumerism by business corporations complicates these issues and invites further research. We begin by arguing that, at least through June 2020, Facebook was involved in injustice significant enough to raise questions of complicity by its advertisers. But does this injustice generate an obligation for advertisers to cancel their contracts? Recent views on the ethics of boycotting by individuals hold that boycotts are a generally permissible form of political expression and likely morally required under certain conditions [2]–[4]. However, we argue that boycotting by companies raises additional considerations and provides a helpful test case for various positions on corporate social responsibility (CSR). Indeed, we suggest that boycotting by corporations may sometimes be morally required, and this obligation challenges the plausibility of certain minimalist conceptions of CSR [5]. Yet, boycotting by corporations may also threaten democratic forms of political contestation, by inhibiting deliberation and equal participation in the resolution of political controversies [6]. This observation reveals the limits of corporate citizenship conceptions of CSR, which encourage corporations to be forceful activists for social change [7]. We propose preliminary principles for the ethics of boycotting by corporations; indicate how these principles relate to different CSR paradigms; and show how these insights contribute to efforts to improve the accountability of technology corporations.",,978-1-6654-0801-1,10.1109/ETHICS53270.2021.9632763,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9632763,social media;hate speech;CSR;boycotts;ethics,Ethics;Social networking (online);Philosophical considerations;Business;Media;Indexes;Hate speech,,1,,,IEEE,9-Dec-21,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences
Windmills of the Mind: Higher-Order Forms of Disinformation in International Politics,J. Shires,"Cybersecurity Governance, Institute of Security and Global Affairs, University of Leiden, The Netherlands",2021 13th International Conference on Cyber Conflict (CyCon),5-Jul-21,2021,,,257,273,"Disinformation - the organised and deliberate circulation of verifiably false information - poses a clear danger to democratic processes and crisis response, including the current coronavirus pandemic. This paper argues for a conceptual step forward in disinformation studies, continuing a trend from the identification of specific pieces of disinformation to the investigation of wider influence campaigns and strategic narrative contestation. However, current work does not conceptually separate first-order forms of disinformation from higher-order forms of disinformation: essentially, the difference between disinformation about political or other events, and disinformation about disinformation itself. This paper argues that this distinction is crucial to understanding the extent and consequences (or lack thereof) of disinformation in international politics. The paper first highlights how political disinformation is often sparked by leaks - the release of secret or confidential information into the public domain. It suggests that disinformation and leaks intersect with conventional cybersecurity threats through the increasingly common phenomenon of hack-and-leak operations.

There have been notable early successes for campaigns using this technology, particularly in 2016 for the Trump presidential campaign and, during the Brexit referendum, the U.K. Leave Campaign. Critiques of these pioneering tools argue that they have adopted unethical practices, and that monitoring the ethical use of such tools is too complex a task, particularly when tools are the intellectual property of private corporations. This article challenges that notion and proposes a way to engage in dialectics with advanced tools of AI in governance as they go about their tasks.

On these platforms, discussions in the form of trending topics provide a glimpse of events happening around the world in real-time. Also, these trends are used for political campaigns, public awareness, and brand promotions. Consequently, these trends are sensitive to manipulation by malicious users who aim to mislead the mass audience. In this article, we identify and study the characteristics of users involved in the manipulation of Twitter trends in Pakistan. We propose “Manipify”-a framework for automatic detection and analysis of malicious users in Twitter trends. Our framework consists of three distinct modules: (1) user classifier, (2) hashtag classifier, and (3) trend analyzer. The user classifier module introduces a novel approach to automatically detect manipulators using tweet content and user behaviour features. Also, the module classifies human and bot users. Next, the hashtag classifier categorizes trending hashtags into six categories assisting in examining manipulators behaviour across different categories. Finally, the trend analyzer module examines users, hashtags, and tweets for hashtag reach, linguistic features, and user behaviour. Our user classifier module achieves 0.92 and 0.98 accuracy in classifying manipulators and bots, respectively. We further test Manipify on the dataset comprising 652 trending hashtags with 5.4 million tweets and 1.9 million users. The analysis of trends reveals that the trending panel is mostly dominated by political hashtags. In addition, our results show a higher contribution of human accounts in trend manipulation as compared to bots.",2688-5255,,10.23919/JSC.2023.0001,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10184140,trend manipulation;bot classification;user analysis;text classification;manipulator detection,Social computing;Social networking (online);Blogs;Market research;Manipulators;Chatbots;Feature extraction;Real-time systems;Task analysis;Sports,,3,,53,,14-Jul-23,,,TUP,TUP Journals

Faceswap, a particular type of Deepfake, consists in swapping faces of two persons in a video. Hence, face swapping can have malicious uses, such as falsifying privacy, interfering with political campaigns, terrorism, and threatening the social stability of the countries. Thus, early detection of this fake content is a primary task to limit their spread. Multiple approaches for DeepFake detection exist in the literature. The most recent and best ones are Identity-Aware and Mesoscopic features-based approaches. However, each of these approaches presents particular limitations. Therefore, in this paper, we propose to take the best out of these two recent approaches and to optimize the performance and robustness of Deepfake content detection.

Predicting Supervise Machine Learning Performances for Sentiment Analysis Using Contextual-Based Approaches,A. Abdul Aziz; A. Starkey,"School of Engineering, University of Aberdeen, Aberdeen, U.K.; School of Engineering, University of Aberdeen, Aberdeen, U.K.",IEEE Access,28-Jan-20,2020,8,,17722,17733,"Sentiment Analysis (SA) is focused on mining opinion (identification and classification) from unstructured text data such as product reviews or microblogs. It is widely used for brand reviews, political campaigns, marketing analysis or gaining feedback from customers. One of the prominent approaches for SA is using supervised machine learning (SML), an algorithm that uses datasets with defined class labels based on mathematical learning from a training dataset. While the results are promising especially with in-domain sentiments, there is no guarantee the model provides the same performance against real time data due to the diversity of new data. In addition, previous studies suggest the result of SML decrease when applied to cross-domain datasets because new features are appeared in different domains. So far, studies in SA emphasise the improvement of the sentiment result whereas there is little discussion focusing on how to detect the degradation of performance for the proposed model. Therefore, we provide a method known as Contextual Analysis (CA), a mechanism that constructs a relationship between words and sources that is constructed in a tree structure identified as Hierarchical Knowledge Tree (HKT). Then, Tree Similarity Index (TSI) and Tree Differences Index (TDI), a formula generate from tree structure are proposed to find similarity as well as changes between train and actual dataset. The regression analysis of datasets reveals that there is a highly significant positive relationship between TSI and SML accuracies. As a result, the prediction model created indicated estimation error within 2.75 to 3.94 and 2.30 for 3.51 for average absolute differences. Moreover, this method also can cluster sentiment words into positive and negative without having any linguistics resources used and at the same time capturing changes of sentiment words when a new dataset is applied.",2169-3536,,10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2958702,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8930507,Text analytics;sentiment analysis;contextual analysis;supervised machine learning,Sentiment analysis;Machine learning;Support vector machines;Testing;Training data;Training;Data models,,52,,31,CCBY,10-Dec-19,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals

It puts a tremendous strain on society by damaging reputation, public trust, freedom of expression, journalism, justice, truth, and democracy. Therefore, it is of paramount importance to detect and contain unreliable information. Multiple techniques have been proposed to detect fake news propagation in tweets based on tweets content, propagation on the network of users, and the profile of the news generators. Generating human-like content allows deceiving content-based methods. Network-based methods rely on the complete graph to detect fake news, resulting in late detection. User profile-based techniques are effective for bots or fake accounts detection. However, they are not suited to detect fake news from original accounts. To deal with the shortcomings in existing methods, we introduce a source-based method focusing on the news propagators’ community, including posters and re-tweeters to detect such contents. Propagators are connected using follower-following relations. A feature set combining the connectivity patterns of news propagators with their profile features is used in a machine learning framework to perform binary classification of tweets. Complex network measures and user profile features are also examined separately. We perform an extensive comparative analysis of the proposed methodology on a real-world COVID-19 dataset, exploiting various machine learning and deep learning models at the community and node levels. Results show that hybrid features perform better than network features and user features alone. Further optimization demonstrates that Ensemble’s boosting model CATBoost and deep learning model RNN are the most effective, with an AUC score of 98%. Furthermore, preliminary results show that the proposed solution can also handle fake news in the political and entertainment domain using a small training set.",2169-3536,,10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3119404,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9567692,Context based model;COVID-19;complex network measures;dis/misinformation;hybrid model;machine learning;pandemics;source based;social media;social network analysis,Social networking (online);Feature extraction;COVID-19;Complex networks;Biological system modeling;Knowledge based systems;Blogs,,31,,89,CCBY,11-Oct-21,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals

The spread of fake news is a classical example of the abuse of social networks by these bad actors. While some have advocated for stricter policies to control the spread of misinformation in social networks, this often happens in detriment of their democratic and organic structure. In this paper, we aim to limit the influence of a target group in a social network via the removal of a few users/links. We formulate the influence limitation problem in a data-driven fashion, by taking into account past propagation traces. More specifically, our algorithms find critical edges to be removed in order to decrease the influence of a target group based on past data. The idea is to control the diffusion processes while minimizing the amount of disturbance in the network structure. Moreover, we consider two types of constraints over edge removals, a budget constraint and also a, more general, set of matroid constraints. These problems lead to interesting challenges in terms of algorithm design. For instance, we are able to show that influence limitation is APX-hard and propose deterministic and probabilistic approximation algorithms for the budgeted and the matroid version of the problem, respectively.

Nowadays, several emotion classifiers and datasets have been built for English texts while few resources are available for other languages.

Unsupervised Discovery Of Semantically Aware Communities With Tensor Kruskal Decomposition: A Case Study In Twitter,G. Drakopoulos; K. Giotopoulos; I. Giannoukou; S. Sioutas,Ionian University; University of Patras; University of Patras; University of Patras,2020 15th International Workshop on Semantic and Social Media Adaptation and Personalization (SMA,9-Nov-20,2020,,,1,8,"Substantial empirical evidence, including the success of synthetic graph generation models as well as of analytical methodologies, suggests that large, real graphs have a recursive community structure. The latter results, in part at least, in other important properties of these graphs such as low diameter, high clustering coefficient values, heavy degree distribution tail, and clustered graph spectrum. Notice that this structure need not be official or moderated like Facebook groups, but it can also take an ad hoc and unofficial form depending on the functionality of the social network under study as for instance the follow relationship on Twitter or the connections between news aggregators on Reddit. Community discovery is paramount in numerous applications such as political campaigns, digital marketing, crowdfunding, and fact checking. Here a tensor representation for Twitter subgraphs is proposed which takes into consideration both the followfollower relationships but also the coherency in hashtags.

Tucker decomposition clearly outperforms the SVD in terms of finding a more compact community size distribution in experiments done in Julia on a Twitter subgraph.

Recently, the role of external forces in inducing opinion displacement and polarization in social networks has attracted significant attention. This is in particular motivated by the necessity to understand and possibly prevent interference phenomena during political campaigns and elections. In this paper, we formulate and solve a targeted intervention problem for opinion displacement minimization on a social network. Specifically, we consider a min-max problem whereby a social planner (the defender) aims at selecting the optimal network intervention within her given budget constraint in order to minimize the opinion displacement in the system that an adversary (the attacker) is instead trying to maximize. Our results show that the optimal intervention of the defender has two regimes. For large enough budget, the optimal intervention of the social planner acts on all nodes proportionally to a new notion of network centrality. For lower budget values, such optimal intervention has a more delicate structure and is rather concentrated on a few target individuals.",2576-2370,978-1-6654-6761-2,10.1109/CDC51059.2022.9992358,Dipartimenti di Eccellenza; ,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9992358,Opinion dynamics;Target interventions;Network systems;Disagreement;Polarization,Social networking (online);Voting;Perturbation methods;Interference;Minimization;Solids,,1,,18,IEEE,10-Jan-23,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

In this context, the group's conversations are not accessible in plain text or readable format by third-party organizations or even the platform owner. Then, the main challenge that emerges is related to getting insights from users' activity of those groups, but without accessing the messages. Previous approaches evaluated the user engagement by assessing user's activity, however, on limited conditions where the data is encrypted, they cannot be applied. In this work, we present a framework for measuring the level of engagement of group conversations and users, without reading the messages. Our framework creates an ensemble of interaction networks that represent the temporal evolution of the conversation, then, we apply the proposed Engagement Index (EI) for each interval of conversations to asses users' participation.

As this hesitancy undermines vaccine campaigns, many researchers have sought to identify its root causes, finding that the increasing volume of anti-vaccine misinformation on social media platforms is a key element of this problem. We explored Twitter as a source of misleading content with the goal of extracting overlapping cultural and political beliefs that motivate the spread of vaccine misinformation. To do this, we have collected a data set of vaccine-related Tweets and annotated them with the help of a team of annotators with a background in communications and journalism. Ultimately we hope this can lead to effective and targeted public health communication strategies for reaching individuals with anti-vaccine beliefs. Moreover, this information helps with developing Machine Learning models to automatically detect vaccine misinformation posts and combat their negative impacts. In this paper, we present Vax-Culture, a novel Twitter COVID-19 dataset consisting of 6373 vaccine-related tweets accompanied by an extensive set of human-provided annotations including vaccine-hesitancy stance, indication of any misinformation in tweets, the entities criticized and supported in each tweet and the communicated message of each tweet.

It not only allows understanding public opinion on various issues, but also aids in monitoring real-time trends and sentiments, critical for domains such as brand management, market research, political campaign management, and crisis management. Central to the effectiveness of sentiment analysis is the extraction of meaningful features from the text data, with sentence embeddings being a vital component in capturing semantic relationships and sentence structures. This paper presents a novel approach to Twitter sentiment analysis that exploits sentence embeddings derived from Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD). DMD, a dimensionality reduction technique, enables us to capture the underlying dynamics of character transitions in tweets and to construct expressive sentence embeddings. The advantage of DMD lies in its ability to represent complex patterns and dependencies within the tweet text, thereby improving the richness of the derived sentence embeddings. Additionally, we investigate the use of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for sentiment classification, harnessing the power of relational modeling in the context of Twitter data. We also delve into word-level analysis with different emotion-based embeddings, assessing their impact on the sentiment classification performance. Our methodology integrates character-level analysis, graph-based modeling, and word-level semantics, providing a comprehensive, multi-layered approach to sentiment analysis on Twitter. Our experiments yield insightful results, highlighting the potential of DMD-based embeddings and the importance of high-quality, context-rich word embeddings in sentiment analysis tasks.

To address this challenge, we formulate a novel influencer tracking problem over a social activity stream. In order to keep the solutions up-to-date and forget outdated data in the stream smoothly, we propose a probabilistic-decaying social activity stream (PDSAS) model that enforces each social activity in the stream participating in the analysis with a probability decaying over time.
